{"name":"CrimsonCTRL","tagline":"Native Android application for the CrimsonUniverse","body":"### Welcome to CrimsonCTRL\r\nThis project is part of the CrimsonUniverse which contains:\r\n\r\n* **CrimsonCore**\r\n\r\nA SparkCore Microcontroller ([Spark.io](https://www.spark.io/)). This is the master control unit of the project, attached to the CrimsonCore is a photo resistor to measure the brightness. If nights fall a relay is switched on and the light of the StoneCircle is switched on. Furthermore a DS18B20 is measuring the temperature. Last not least a [Digole 1,8\" OLED display](http://www.digole.com/index.php?productID=859) is used to visualise the data.\r\n* **CrimsonControl**\r\n\r\nIs a HTML5 frontend that receives the data from the SparkCloud.\r\n\r\n* **CrimsonCAM**\r\n\r\nIs a camera module attached to a Raspberry PI. The software [motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome) is used for motion-tracking.\r\n\r\n* **CrimsonCTRL**\r\n\r\nThis project is a native Android application. You can manual switch the Stone Cirle Light on or off and get the temperature and the values from the photo resistor\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nOf course you see, this is highly specialised project based on my own needs, feel free to have a look at my code and use it for your own needs. \r\n\r\n### Bow row\r\nMay I say thank you to the following persons, without them this application does not exist. Therefore thank you 4nt1g for the huge work with the httpsUrlConnection and parsing the JSON Data code. Thank you that you try to understand what I want to do and help me getting this to work. Thank you Seelenf√§nger for you initial code example. And last not least Bonnie, for being there and all you have done for me in the last years.\\n\\n\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\nCopyright (C) 2015 CrimsonClyde\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\\\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
