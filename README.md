CrimsonCTRL is my native Android application. It includes all features that are also used within the CrimsonSpace but stripped down to the basics and focused on being as easy to use as possible.
CrimsonCTRL is a native Android Application within a home automation system build upon a Particle Core. Itention was to build a sleek, stripped down, logical user interface to see on a spot all states of sensor, servers and services running in the CrimsonUniverse.
