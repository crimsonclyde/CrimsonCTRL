CrimsonCTRL is my native Android application. It includes all features that are also used within the CrimsonSpace but stripped down to the basics and focused on being as easy to use as possible.

 
#### Features
- Receiving the current temperature, state of the stone circle control relay and the resistance of the photo resistor
- Long-press triggers the CrimsonCore to set the relay to on Voilà the stone circle is illuminated
- Linux server and service information including server status, uptime and Apache2 service. Created with WebSocket.
- MJPEG Support; Fetches the MJPEG Stream from CrimsonHome
- Temperature Graph; Get the trend from the weather temperature measured by CrimsonCore.
- Settings; A settings page to add/alter/delete your enviroment. To make things easy it´s possible to scan a QR Code to get all variables set
