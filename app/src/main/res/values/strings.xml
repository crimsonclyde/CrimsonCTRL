May I say thank you to the following persons, without them this application does not exist. Therefore thank you 4nt1g for the huge work with the httpsUrlConnection and parsing the JSON Data code. Thank you that you try to understand what I want to do and help me getting this to work. Thank you Seelenf√§nger for you initial code example. And last not least Bonnie, for being there and all you have done for me in the last years.\n\n
